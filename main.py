    # üåø Welcome to Team 11's Plant Disease Recognition System! üîç

    We‚Äôre **Team 11**, and we‚Äôre excited to assist you in identifying plant diseases quickly and accurately.

    Our goal is to help farmers, gardeners, and agricultural specialists detect plant diseases early‚Äîso we can all work together to ensure healthier crops and stronger yields. Simply upload a photo of a plant, and let our intelligent system do the analysis for you.

    ---

    ### üöÄ How It Works

    1. **Upload an Image:** Head to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload a photo of the plant you suspect may be affected.
    2. **Image Analysis:** Our system processes the image using advanced machine learning models to detect signs of disease.
    3. **Get Results:** View the diagnostic results along with helpful recommendations for next steps.

    ---

    ### üåü Why Use Team 11's System?

    - **High Accuracy:** Powered by cutting-edge AI techniques to ensure reliable predictions.
    - **Easy to Use:** Clean, user-friendly interface‚Äîno technical skills needed.
    - **Fast Results:** Get insights in just seconds to act swiftly.
